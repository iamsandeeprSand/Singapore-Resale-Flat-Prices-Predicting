# Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction Application

## Overview

This project is a Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction application developed using Streamlit. It leverages machine learning models (Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression) to predict the resale price of flats based on various input features such as month, town, flat type, block, street name, storey range, floor area, flat model, lease commence date, and year.

## Features

- **Predictive Models:** The application uses machine learning models (Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression) to provide resale price predictions.

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input specific details about the flat, such as month, town, flat type, etc., through an interactive interface created using Streamlit.

- **Dropdown Menus and Input Fields:** Dropdown menus and input fields allow users to select and input the necessary information for predicting the resale price.
